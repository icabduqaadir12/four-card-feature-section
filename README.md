## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5  
- SCSS (Sass)  
- CSS Grid  
- Flexbox  
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Deepened my understanding of **CSS Grid**, especially how to use `grid-template-columns`, `grid-area`, and alignment properties effectively.
- Learned how to center a grid container and place cards using column spans and rows.
- Practiced combining **Grid** for the outer layout with **Flexbox** for internal alignment of card contents.
- Maintained consistent spacing using SCSS variables and reusable styles.

```

### Continued development

- Explore more advanced CSS Grid layouts, such as overlapping areas and named grid lines
- Practice creating reusable SCSS partials and mixins for layout components
- Improve responsive scaling between tablet and desktop breakpoints using `minmax()` and `auto-fit`
- Apply accessibility best practices for layout and content flow
